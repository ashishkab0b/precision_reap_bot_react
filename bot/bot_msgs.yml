    <p>Hello! Please think of an issue in your life that has been bothering you. This issue should be something that really matters to you and preferably something that is an ongoing or recurring issue that may potentially continue to bother you in the future. The issue could be something that is happening in the outside world, or it could be a mental or emotional pattern that is interfering with your life. <p/><p> Some examples of relevant issues are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a chronic illness of yours or of a loved one</li>
        <li>a disagreement with someone (e.g. partner, friend, family member, neighbor, etc.) that has re-occurred or lasted more than one day</li>
        <li>something you are dissatisfied with in your job</li>
        <li>a trait about yourself you do not like (e.g. frequent procrastination)</li>
        <li>a social or political issue which you care deeply about</li>
        <li>an unwanted emotional pattern (e.g. outbursts of disproportionate anger)</li>
      </ul>

    <p>Thank you for telling us about your issue. In the next section of the study, we will show you a list of values and ask you to rate how important those values are to you.</p>
    <p>When we say "important," we refer to how much these values shape the way you evaluate the world around you and influence your decisions.</p>
    <p><b>We are asking about your values IN GENERAL and not specifically as they relate to the issue you reported.</b></p>
    <p>We will ask you about 32 values in total.</p>
    <p><b>Please recognize that not all values can be of equal (or maximum) importance.</b> This is because choices in life often require prioritizing one value over another, and in those cases, we must decide which value is more important.</p>
    <p>Thus, when filling out the survey, try to give each value a different numerical rating than the other values as best you can.</p>
